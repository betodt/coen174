//trust anything sent from client side, even with JS validation on that side


//if student not in waitlist already, add, and return something along the lines of the 
//existing student_success.html

//if already in waitlist, then return something along the lines of how we showed the
//"your're already in the waitlist." or we could just ignore returning something different,
//and just not re-add to the waitlist
